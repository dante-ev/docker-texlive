# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/).

This project cannot adhere to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/), because it builds on TeXLive, which introcuces breaking changes now and then.
Thus, each new version would lead to a new major version.
Instead, we version `YYYY-RR`, where `YYYY` is TeXLive version this image is based on and `RR` is numbering different releases in that cycle.
